Restrictions
Textures you generate CANNOT be sold in texture packs. This tool is made freely available in browsers so that they don't have to be.

If you do create your own textures and want to include them with other types of assets (like a game template for example), please provide a direct link to this page in some way (i.e read me file) so that people using your assets can generate additional textures for themselves and their own projects.

Crediting me in your projects is not necessary, but is appreciated.
